```

About
-----

This is **MQTT+**, an addon JavaScript/TypeScript API for the excellent
[MQTT.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mqtt), for additional
communication patterns like [Remote Procedure
Call](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call) (RPC).
This allows a bi-directional request/response-style
communication over the technically uni-directional message protocol
[MQTT](http://mqtt.org).

Conceptually, the **MQTT+** API provides two types of communication patterns:

- **Event Emission**:
  Event Emission is a *uni-directional* communication pattern.
  An Event is the combination of an event name and optionally zero or more arguments.
  You *subscribe* to events.
  When an event is *emitted*, either a single particular subscriber (in case of
  a directed event emission) or all subscribers are called and receive the
  arguments as extra information.
  In contrast to the regular MQTT message publish/subscribe, this
  pattern allows to direct the event to particular subscribers and
  provides optional information about the sender to subscribers.

- **Service Call**:
  Service Call is a *bi-directional* communication pattern.
  A Service is the combination of a service name and optionally zero or more arguments.
  You *register* for a service.
  When a service is *called*, a single particular registrator (in case
  of a directed service call) or one arbitrary registrator is called and
  receives the arguments as the request. The registrator then has to
  provide the service response.

> [!Note]
> **MQTT+** is similar to and derived from
> [MQTT-JSON-RPC](https://github.com/rse/mqtt-json-rpc) of the same
> author, but instead of just JSON, MQTT+ encodes packets as JSON
> or CBOR (default), uses an own packet format (allowing sender and
> receiver information) and uses shorter NanoIDs instead of longer UUIDs
> for identification of sender, receiver and requests.

Usage
-----

### API:

```ts
export type API = {
    "example/sample": (a1: string, a2: boolean) => void
    "example/hello":  (a1: string, a2: number)  => string
}
```

### Server:

```ts
import MQTT         from "mqtt"
import MQTTp        from "mqtt-plus"
import type { API } from [...]

const mqtt  = MQTT.connect("wss://127.0.0.1:8883", { ... })
const mqttp = new MQTTp<API>(mqtt)

mqtt.on("connect", async () => {
    mqttp.subscribe("example/sample", (a1, a2) => {
        console.log("example/sample: ", a1, a2)
    })
    mqttp.register("example/hello", (a1, a2) => {
        console.log("example/hello: ", a1, a2)
        return `${a1}:${a2}`
    })
})
```

### Client:

```ts
import MQTT         from "mqtt"
import MQTTp        from "mqtt-plus"
import type { API } from [...]

const mqtt = MQTT.connect("wss://127.0.0.1:8883", { ... })
const mqttp = new MQTTp<API>(mqtt)

mqtt.on("connect", () => {
    mqttp.emit("example/sample", "foo", true)
    mqttp.call("example/hello", "world", 42).then((response) => {
        console.log("example/hello response: ", response)
        mqtt.end()
    })
})
```

Application Programming Interface
---------------------------------

The MQTT+ API provides the following methods:

- **Construction**:<br/>

      constructor(
          mqtt: MqttClient,
          options?: {
              id:                        string
              codec:                     "cbor" | "json"
              timeout:                   number
              topicEventNoticeMake:      (topic: string) => TopicMatching | null
              topicServiceRequestMake:   (topic: string) => TopicMatching | null
              topicServiceResponseMake:  (topic: string) => TopicMatching | null
              topicEventNoticeMatch:     { name: string, clientId?: string }
              topicServiceRequestMatch:  { name: string, clientId?: string }
              topicServiceResponseMatch: { name: string, clientId?: string }
          }
      )

  The `mqtt` is the [MQTT.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mqtt) instance,
  which has to be establish separately.
  The optional `options` object supports the following fields:
  - `id`: Custom MQTT peer identifier (default: auto-generated NanoID).
  - `codec`: Encoding format (default: `cbor`).
  - `timeout`: Communication timeout in milliseconds (default: `10000`).
  - `topicEventNoticeMake`: Custom topic generation for event notices.
    (default: `` (name, clientId) => clientId ? `${name}/event-notice/${clientId}` : `${name}/event-notice` ``)
  - `topicServiceRequestMake`: Custom topic generation for service requests.
    (default: `` (name, clientId) => clientId ? `${name}/service-request/${clientId}` : `${name}/service-request` ``)
  - `topicServiceResponseMake`): Custom topic generation for service responses.
    (default: `` (name, clientId) => clientId ? `${name}/service-response/${clientId}` : `${name}/service-response` ``)
  - `topicEventNoticeMatch`: Custom topic matching for event notices.
    (default: `` (topic) => { const m = topic.match(/^(.+?)\/event-notice(?:\/(.+))?$/); return m ? { name: m[1], clientId: m[2] } : null } ``)
  - `topicServiceRequestMatch`: Custom topic matching for service requests.
    (default: `` (topic) => { const m = topic.match(/^(.+?)\/service-request(?:\/(.+))?$/); return m ? { name: m[1], clientId: m[2] } : null } ``)
  - `topicServiceResponseMatch`: Custom topic matching for service responses.
    (default: `` (topic) => { const m = topic.match(/^(.+?)\/service-response\/(.+)$/); return m ? { name: m[1], clientId: m[2] } : null } ``)

- **Event Subscription**:<br/>

      /*  (simplified TypeScript API method signature)  */
      subscribe(
          event:    string,
          options?: MQTT::IClientSubscribeOptions
          callback: (...params: any[], info?: sender: string, receiver?: string) => void
      ): Promise<Subscription>

  Subscribe to an event.
  The `event` has to be a valid MQTT topic name.
  The optional `options` allows setting MQTT.js `subscribe()` options like `qos`.
  The `callback` is called with the `params` passed to a remote `emit()`.
  There is no return value of `callback`.

  Internally, on the MQTT broker, the topics generated by
  `topicEventNoticeMake()` (default: `${event}/event-notice` and
  `${event}/event-notice/${clientId}`) are subscribed. Returns a
  `Subscription` object with an `unsubscribe()` method.

- **Service Registration**:<br/>

      /*  (simplified TypeScript API method signature)  */
      register(
          service:  string,
          options?: MQTT::IClientSubscribeOptions
          callback: (...params: any[], info?: sender: string, receiver?: string) => any
      ): Promise<Registration>

  Register a service.
  The `service` has to be a valid MQTT topic name.
  The optional `options` allows setting MQTT.js `subscribe()` options like `qos`.
  The `callback` is called with the `params` passed to a remote `call()`.
  The return value of `callback` will resolve the `Promise` returned by the remote `call()`.

  Internally, on the MQTT broker, the topics by
  `topicServiceRequestMake()` (default: `${service}/service-request` and
  `${service}/service-request/${clientId}`) are subscribed. Returns a
  `Registration` object with an `unregister()` method.

- **Event Emission**:<br/>

      /*  (simplified TypeScript API method signature)  */
      emit(
          event:     string,
          receiver?: Receiver,
          options?:  MQTT::IClientSubscribeOptions,
          ...params: any[]
      ): void

  Emit an event to all subscribers or a specific subscriber ("fire and forget").
  The optional `receiver` directs the event to a specific subscriber only.
  The optional `options` allows setting MQTT.js `publish()` options like `qos` or `retain`.

  The remote `subscribe()` `callback` is called with `params` and its
  return value is silently ignored.

  Internally, publishes to the MQTT topic by `topicEventNoticeMake(event, clientId)`
  (default: `${event}/event-notice` or `${event}/event-notice/${clientId}`).

- **Service Call**:<br/>

      /*  (simplified TypeScript API method signature)  */
      call(
          service:   string,
          receiver?: Receiver,
          options?:  MQTT::IClientSubscribeOptions,
          ...params: any[]
      ): Promise<any>

  Call a service on all registrants or on a specific registrant ("request and response").
  The optional `receiver` directs the call to a specific registrant only.
  The optional `options` allows setting MQTT.js `publish()` options like `qos` or `retain`.

  The remote `register()` `callback` is called with `params` and its
  return value resolves the returned `Promise`. If the remote `callback`
  throws an exception, this rejects the returned `Promise`.

  Internally, on the MQTT broker, the topic by `topicServiceResponseMake(service, clientId)`
  (default: `${service}/service-response/${clientId}`) is temporarily subscribed
  for receiving the response.

- **Receiver Wrapping**:<br/>

      receiver(
          id: string
      ): Receiver

  Wrap a receiver ID string for use with `emit()` or `call()` to direct the
  message to a specific receiver. Returns a `Receiver` object.

Internals
---------

In the following, assume that an MQTT+ instance is created with:

```ts
import MQTT  from "mqtt"
import MQTTp from "mqtt-plus"

const mqtt  = MQTT.connect("...", { ... })
const mqttp = new MQTTp(mqtt, { codec: "json" })
```

Internally, remote services are assigned to MQTT topics. When calling a
remote service named `example/hello` with parameters `"world"` and `42` via...

```ts
mqttp.call("example/hello", "world", 42).then((result) => {
    ...
})
```

...the following message is sent to the permanent MQTT topic
`example/hello/service-request` (the shown NanoIDs are just pseudo
ones):

```json
{
    "id":      "RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR",
    "sender":  "SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS",
    "method":  "example/hello",
    "params":  [ "world", 42 ]
}
```

Beforehand, this `example/hello` service should have been registered with...

```ts
mqttp.register("example/hello", (a1, a2) => {
    return `${a1}:${a2}`
})
```

...and then its result, in the above `mqttp.call()` example `"world:42"`, is then
sent back as the following success response
message to the temporary (client-specific) MQTT topic
`example/hello/service-response/SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS`:

```json
{
    "id":      "RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR",
    "sender":  "SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS",
    "result":  "world:42"
}
```

The `sender` field is the NanoID of the MQTT+ sender instance and
`id` is the NanoID of the particular service request. The `sender` is
used for sending back the response message to the requestor only. The
`id` is used for correlating the response to the request only.

Broker Setup
------------

For a real test-drive of MQTT+, install the
[Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/) MQTT broker and a `mosquitto.conf`
file like...

```
[...]

password_file        mosquitto-pwd.txt
acl_file             mosquitto-acl.txt

[...]

#   additional listener
listener             1883 127.0.0.1
max_connections      -1
protocol             mqtt

[...]
```

...and an access control list in `mosquitto-acl.txt` like...

```
#   shared ACL
topic   read      $SYS/#
pattern write     $SYS/broker/connection/%c/state
pattern readwrite %u/#

#   anonymous ACL
topic   read      event/+
pattern read      event/+/%c
topic   write     event/+/+
pattern read      service/+/%c
topic   write     service/+
topic   write     service/+/+

#   user ACL
user    example
topic   read      event/+
pattern read      event/+/%c
topic   write     event/+
topic   write     event/+/+
topic   read      service/+
pattern read      service/+/%c
topic   write     service/+
topic   write     service/+/+
```

...and an `example` user (with password `example`) in `mosquitto-pwd.txt` like:

```
example:$6$awYNe6oCAi+xlvo5$mWIUqyy4I0O3nJ99lP1mkRVqsDGymF8en5NChQQxf7KrVJLUp1SzrrVDe94wWWJa3JGIbOXD9wfFGZdi948e6A==
```

Alternatively, you can use the [NPM package mosquitto](https://npmjs.com/mosquitto)
for an equal setup.

Example
-------

You can test-drive MQTT+ with a complete [sample](sample/sample.ts) to see
it in action and tracing its communication (the typing of the `MQTTp`
class with `API` is optional, but strongly suggested):

```ts
import Mosquitto from "mosquitto"
import MQTT      from "mqtt"
import MQTTp     from "mqtt-plus"

const mosquitto = new Mosquitto()
await mosquitto.start()
await new Promise((resolve) => { setTimeout(resolve, 500) })

const mqtt = MQTT.connect("mqtt://127.0.0.1:1883", {
    username: "example",
    password: "example"
})

type API = {
    "example/sample": (a1: string, a2: number) => void
    "example/hello":  (a1: string, a2: number) => string
}

const mqttp = new MQTTp<API>(mqtt, { codec: "json" })

type Sample = (a: string, b: number) => string

mqtt.on("error",     (err)            => { console.log("ERROR", err) })
mqtt.on("offline",   ()               => { console.log("OFFLINE") })
mqtt.on("close",     ()               => { console.log("CLOSE") })
mqtt.on("reconnect", ()               => { console.log("RECONNECT") })
mqtt.on("message",   (topic, message) => { console.log("RECEIVED", topic, message.toString()) })

mqtt.on("connect", () => {
    console.log("CONNECT")
    mqttp.register("example/hello", (a1, a2) => {
        console.log("example/hello: request: ", a1, a2)
        return `${a1}:${a2}`
    })
    mqttp.call("example/hello", "world", 42).then((result) => {
        console.log("example/hello success: ", result)
        mqtt.end()
        await mosquitto.stop()
    }).catch((err) => {
        console.log("example/hello error: ", err)
    })
})
```

The output will be:

```
$ node sample.ts
CONNECT
example/sample: info:  world 42 undefined
RECEIVED example/sample/event-notice {"id":"GraDZnA4BLrF66g9qmpPX","sender":"2IBMSk0NPnrz1AeTERoea","event":"example/sample","params":["world",42]}
RECEIVED example/hello/service-request {"id":"vwLzfQDu2uEeOdOfIlT42","sender":"2IBMSk0NPnrz1AeTERoea","service":"example/hello","params":["world",42]}
example/hello: request:  world 42 undefined
RECEIVED example/hello/service-response/2IBMSk0NPnrz1AeTERoea {"id":"vwLzfQDu2uEeOdOfIlT42","sender":"2IBMSk0NPnrz1AeTERoea","receiver":"2IBMSk0NPnrz1AeTERoea","result":"world:42"}
example/hello success:  world:42
CLOSE
```
